	<main class="aboutMeContent">
		<p> I see myself as a creative leader and visionary. I am currently a full-time student at WeCanCodeIT in Columbus, Ohio. I am a graduate of Ohio Dominican University, and also Sandusky High School. I was a member of the football and track and field teams at both schools. I found myself being named captain of the University track team, high school football team and high school track team. I was a mentor to many younger teamates on my college football team. I enjoy learning and building a better version of myself. </p>
		<p> My toolbox for coding includes Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and TDD</p>
